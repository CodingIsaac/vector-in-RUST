Create a function that takes one argument called val that is of type Vec with the values: 1,3,5,7. Inside of this function check the first value of the vector and see if it is equal to one. If the value is equal to one, then return true, otherwise return false. Next add the value 20 to the vector. Print out the vector to confirm your results.
